# Bootstrap-Portfolio

## Description

In this week's challenge, we were instructed to recreate our portfolio pages from Week 2, but this time using Bootstrap as much as possible. I have also included an extra section, as per the requirements, showing the skills and tasks we are undertaking and improving on each week during the course. I have included new links back to my msot recently created work, as well as new link stylings and social media icons.

This portfolio will be a good place to show off the work that we complete each week and will be updated accordingly with new pieces of work to show my progress throughout the course.

I can clearly see the advantages in using a framework such as Bootstrap for creating websites as the in-built classes are so useful as a time-saver. This allowed me to spend more time making minor changes to the appearance of the website rather than spending a long time on the layout as in week 2.
